for self-checking their submission.

Game Setup
==========
When the game first starts, you will be presented with the character selection screen. Use the **Arrow** keys or the **A/D** keys to navigate the models. Once you have chosen your model hit the **Enter** key. The **Enter** key will start the game.

Playing the Game
================
When the game starts, bugs are marching across the screen. Your job, as our Serenity hero, is to cross the sea of bugs and get to the river. Once you reach the river, you find yourself back in the grass.

Once you have crossed the road once, items start appearing in the road, Gems, Hearts and Keys. Collect these items and you will be reward with points.

* Blue Gem: 5 Points
* Green Gem: 10 Points
* Orange Gem: 20 Points
* Heart: 30 Points
* Key: 40 Points

To pause the game, hit the [P] key or the [Space].

To restart the game hit the [R] key. You will be asked to confirm this decision. When you restart, your score will be lost, but not your high score.
